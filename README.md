A combination of clientside and serverside analytics for PHP-based websites. This repository builds upon existing analytics solutions and offers integrations for [Matomo](https://matomo.org) and [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com).

It is recommended to use SCAnalytics with composer, which is the easiest way to use it. Just add `promatur/sc-analytics` to your projects requirements.

```
composer require promatur/sc-analytics

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

```
